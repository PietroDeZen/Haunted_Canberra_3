The website aims to be be a simple single page site.
Most of the code is based on tutorials found online that 
has been later adapted to fit with the aim of the code
and the context that the website would need to represent.

Javascript has been used to make the image-slide function
and the lightbox. However, the lightbox is not very efficient 
has by clicking outside of the background: #ffffffd4; 
(line 320 style.css) it won't work. I supposed because that <div>
element (line 120 index.html)does not cover the entire page. 
Consequently, when clicking outside of it the conditional if()
(line 29 script.js) cannot respond to the 'click' event.
