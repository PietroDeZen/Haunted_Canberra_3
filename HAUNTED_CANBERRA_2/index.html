  Though Canberra is arguably a quite city
  known mainly for its political history, the city has 
  also home to some scary haunted places. Out of all,
  four are the ones that might be regarded as the most
  spiritually active: Blundells cottage, The National Museum,
  Hotel Kurrajong and  The National Film Archive.

    <div  class="bcottage">
    <h2 class="cottage-title">Blundells Cottage</h2>
    <p class="story-1">Built in the 1860, the cottage
      was surronded by farming land and crops. In 1874
      the Blundells family moved in. The legend says that 
      George and Flora Blundells' daughter sadly passed away
      when she was only a teenager. Cause of her death? Burnt alive.
      It is said that the poor girl was ironing when eventually an 
      unescapable fire took place taking the young girl's life.
      To these days, visitors witness paranormal activities happening
      in that place. The most recurrent paranormal phenomenon is a smell
      of burning flashes. Perhaps, an evidence of the brutal and sudden death 
      that still keeps the soul of the poor girl on this world.

  <div id="NationalMuseum" class="cottage-container">
    
    <div  class="bcottage">
    <h2 class="cottage-title">The National Museum</h2>
    <p class="story-1">Probably, the least place that comes to mind 
      when thinking about spooky places in Canberra. However, it is 
      said that in one of the rooms of the building many visitors have seen 
      an old woman in a bathtub. There's only a problem though, neither the 
      woman nor the bathtub is phisically there. The National Museum stands 
      where there previously was the Royal Canberra Hospital and the woman might still have not 
      find her way out of a building that no longer exhist. Will she be stuck in the 
      Museum till the end of times?

    <h2 class="cottage-title">Hotel Kurrajong</h2>
    <p class="story-1">Hotel Kurrajong is one of the buildings
      where the history of the young capital of Australia has been made.
      Together with what is now known as the Hyatt Hotel Canberra, it
      used to be a place where politicians stayed while on duty.
      However, although almost a century has passed, someone never left.
      He's name is Ben Chiffley former prime minister of Australia. 
      He suffered a fatal heart attack while in his room and people say that a part 
      of him is still there. Many have witnessed what is considered to be his ghost.
      What does it look like? When appearing, it usally manifests itself as a middle-age man
      wearing a grey suit who from the window of his room look toward the old Parliament House.

  <div id="NationalFilmA" class="cottage-container">
    
   <div  class="bcottage">
    <h2 class="cottage-title">National Film Archive</h2>
    <p class="story-1"> Can horror movies function as a bridge to allow
      for entities in the afterlife to come in our world? Well, the reality
      of this place is a bit darker. Before being converted to a film archive,
      this building was home to the Australian Institue of Anatomy. The original idea 
      was to create a space dedicated to science. Thus, exposed to the public there
      weren't only dead animal bodies but also human ones. Little did they know that messing
      with the dead is not a good idea. Both visitors and staff members have experienced 
      paranormal activities. Such activities range from objects falling from anti-gravity shelves
      to creepier ones like seeing children faces appearing from behind grates.
